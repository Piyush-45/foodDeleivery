<!-- ~update function  -->
The function starts by using the useQueryClient hook provided by React Query. This hook gives access to the query client instance, which is used to invalidate queries after a successful mutation.

The function then returns the useMutation hook. This hook is provided by React Query and is used to perform mutation operations.

Inside the useMutation hook, an asynchronous mutationFn function is defined. This function is responsible for executing the actual mutation operation, which in this case is updating a product in the database.

Inside the mutationFn function:

The supabase client is used to update the product in the products table of the database. The update method is called on the products table, and the eq method is used to specify the condition that the update should apply to a product with a specific id.
The name, image, and price fields of the product are updated with the new values provided in the data object.
The select('*') method is used to specify that all fields of the updated product should be returned.
The single() method is used to ensure that only one record is returned.
If there's an error during the update operation, an error is thrown with the error message.

If the update operation is successful, the onSuccess callback function is executed. Inside this function:

The invalidateQueries method of the queryClient is called to invalidate the cache for the products query. This ensures that the list of products is refetched from the server the next time it's requested.
Another call to invalidateQueries is made with the key ['products', data.id]. This invalidates the cache for the specific product that was updated, ensuring that its data is refetched as well.
